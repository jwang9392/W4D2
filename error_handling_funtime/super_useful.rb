# Instructions
# Friendly monster is really friendly and really likes coffee, so he'd like to give us another try, but only when we give him "coffee".

# First, handle the errors being thrown by #reaction in #feed_me_a_fruit.

# Note that #reaction throws errors receiving an argument that is not in FRUITS. Next, let's differentiate the errors thrown so our calling function, #feed_me_a_fruit can try to feed friendly monster again, but only when they've given it coffee.

# Now that we have different error types being thrown by #reaction we can do a little conditional logic in #feed_me_a_fruit to retry the failing block of code again, but only if it is a coffee-related error.



# PHASE 3
FRUITS = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

    puts "OMG, thanks so much for the #{maybe_fruit}!"
